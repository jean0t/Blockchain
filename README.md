# Blockchain Experiments

Welcome to the Blockchain Experiments repository! This is a personal project where I explore and experiment with blockchain technology using Python and Go.

## About the Project

This repository contains various experiments and code samples related to blockchain development. The main goal is to understand the inner workings of blockchain technology, including concepts such as cryptographic hashing, consensus algorithms, and smart contracts.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** For scripting, data manipulation, and implementing various blockchain algorithms.
- **Go (Golang):** For building high-performance, concurrent blockchain components.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into different directories, each representing a specific experiment or concept within blockchain technology. Here is a brief overview:

- `blockchainpy/`: Contains Python scripts and projects related to blockchain experiments.
- `blockchaingo/`: Contains Go code and projects related to blockchain experiments.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, you will need to have both Python and Go installed on your system.

### Python

1. Install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r python/requirements.txt```
   

### Go

1. Install Go from the [official website](https://golang.org/).
2. Set up your Go environment by following the instructions on the website.

## Usage

Feel free to browse through the different directories and run the experiments. Each directory contains a `example` file that explains he usage and a `tests` file that might be helpful to understand the behavior of each file and its functions.

## Contributions

Please note that I am not accepting contributions to this repository as it is a personal project. However, you are welcome to fork the repository and experiment on your own.
